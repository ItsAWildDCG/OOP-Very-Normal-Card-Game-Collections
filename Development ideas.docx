*Main game idea:
  - Player will fight enemies using card types with point x multiply score calculation:
    + Better type makes you an attacker
    + Worse type makes you a defender
    + Base score and multiplier would be calculated from hand type 







*Items idea:
D(C): draw 1 card from the deck to your hand
D(C): draw 1 card from the deck to the shared pot
D(C): remove a card from the shared pot
D(C): increase the rank of 1 card in your hand
D(C): decrease the rank of 1 card in your hand
(C): reveal a card from the dealer
D(C): deal 10 damage to the dealer
(C): fold your hand, gain 25 def
D(C): regain 20% of your starting chips
(C): regain the next 3 rounds' blinds
(U): if your hand has no suit with more than 1 card, draw until there is a suit with 2 or more cards
D(U): draw a card from the deck to your hand, to the dealer and to the shared pot
(U): double your atk, set your def to 0
(U): swap your atk and def
(U): gain $ equal to damage dealt this round
(U): lose 10 chips, draw 3 cards
(U): add a copy of a card in hand to the deck and draw 1 card from the deck to your hand
(R): select a card, change all cards in hand's suit to the selected card's suit 
(R): turn all face cards in play to kings
(R): add a void card to your hand
(R): remove a selected card from your hand, remove a random card from the dealer
(R): add 2 "Two of Diamonds" cards to your hand





Rank could go above 13(King) for sth like Emperor, Sage, God
Making extra suits with gimmicks like Reverse, Void (Temporarily disable enemy or self special ability), ShapeShifter (Randomize themself each turn)

* Unlocking new card suit idea:
  - Void: unlocking by trying to draw from an empty deck 10 times in a row (drawX would be counted as 1)
    + Can be used as any rank or any suit (or every), but will cost you sth
    + NPC voice line after the 1st void card drawn: "Holy shit! Where did ya pull that from?"

  - Reverse: unlocking by playing a hand with out-of-bounds cards only (different from 1-13 ranks and 4 default suits)
    + Ranks and Suits are reversed (Flush would now be Five of a kind)
    + NPC voice line after playing the first out-of-bond hand: "Ya sure ya are not cheating?"
