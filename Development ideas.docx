*Main game idea:
  - Player will fight enemies using card types with point x multiply score calculation:
    + Better type makes you an attacker
    + Worse type makes you a defender
    + Base score and multiplier would be calculated from hand type 













Rank could go above 13(King) for sth like Emperor, Sage, God
Making extra suits with gimmicks like Reverse, Void (Temporarily disable enemy or self special ability), ShapeShifter (Randomize themself each turn)

* Unlocking new card suit idea:
  - Void: unlocking by trying to draw from an empty deck 10 times in a row (drawX would be counted as 1)
    + Can be used as any rank or any suit (or every), but will cost you sth
    + NPC voice line after the 1st void card drawn: "Holy shit! Where did ya pull that from?"
